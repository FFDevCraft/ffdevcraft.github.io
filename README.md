### 👨‍💻 About Me
Hi, I'm the developer behind FFDevCraft – a passionate software creator from Slovakia who enjoys building both games and useful tools.

I started my professional career developing internal software used across branches in the banking sector, primarily focusing on .NET desktop solutions. Later, in a company focused on economic software, I worked on desktop applications and backend systems, while also maintaining and extending features in their Android apps, including deployments and updates.

Currently, I’m part of the team at a health insurance company, where I focus on backend development using modern .NET technologies.

In my free time, I love experimenting with game development, learning new frameworks, and working with tools like Unity, Firebase, and GitHub Actions.
FFDevCraft is my personal playground – a place where I mix creativity with code and share the results with the world.

Always learning. Always building. 💡👨‍💻
